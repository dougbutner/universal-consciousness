# Errata / Clarifications

**Clarification: Archangels in the Upper Matrices (Video Course Only)**
Lesson: **Matrices**
In the original script I included information (Source: Aridif) about how Archangels were from the 12th density. I decided to leave it out of the video version, but left it on Github. 


**Clarification: 0th and 10th dimension are the same**
Lesson:  **Dimensions**
0th and 10th dimensionality are both the omnipresence connecting All. They are the same, like 360° and 0° on a circle, though in this case the circle is a torus.

**Clarification: 0th and 10th dimension are the unity point of every density level**
For densities and dimensions to co-exist, consciousness must be present at each point the densities can express. The ever-presence of the 0th dimension, which is the 10th dimensional "All-as-One" create this link between all consciousness and all "physical" experienceable reality.

**Clarification: 4th, 5th, and 6 densities can have collective consciousness experiences**
In the course, 7th density marks the first non-physical collective conscious experience. While the 7th density if the first true collective experience, removed from physicality, the lower densities (particularly 4, 5, 6, though truly all the way down) have collective experiences which become more integrated as the densities are progressed.

**Clarification: Distortion of the containing (higher) density's tori's information** 
(From A.A Exclusive density lesson) Every piece of the galaxy remains in a level of resonance with the galaxy itself, which 


**Erratum: Saying that we had courses by myself and compiled works on Aquarius Academy**
We have a wonderful [Taoist Yoga course]() by Heng Ni on Aquarius Academy as well. 
We hope to welcome many more instructors in the future!  


# Critical Thinking Questions
Answer these questions to test your comprehension and find where you would like to do more research.
1. List all the densities, and figure out what dimensions are most crucial to the operation of each density and why.
2. Do you think there is another 3-axis system above the 9th dimension (10, 11, and 12)? Why or why not?
3. What do you think is the relation between first density and 13th density?
