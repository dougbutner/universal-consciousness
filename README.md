# Universal Consciousness
### The 7-11-12 Model of Universal Consciousness: Dimensions,  Densities, and Matrices

# About This Repo
This repo holds a summary of a model of universal structure and consciousness. All lessons are in Markdown format, with images and sources where applicable.

### This content was created for a video course called Universal Consciousness: Densities, Dimensions, Matrices + Grids, now available on [**aquarius.academy**](https://aquarius.academy/learn/universal-consciousness-densities-dimensions-matrices-grids/), [**udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/universal-consciousness), and [**youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRRVgL5-YYRXx2wwGewdBxUl5Mr5--4u1).

The version on [**aquarius.academy**](https://aquarius.academy/learn/universal-consciousness-densities-dimensions-matrices-grids/) also includes the corresponding full text from this repository with each video lesson.

# Errata / Clarifications

**Clarification: Archangels in the Upper Matrices (Video Course Only)**
Lesson: **Matrices**
In the original script I included information (Source: Aridif) about how Archangels were from the 12th density. I decided to leave it out of the video version, but left it on Github. 


**Clarification: 0th and 10th dimension are the same**
Lesson:  **Dimensions**
0th and 10th dimensionality are both the omnipresence connecting All. They are the same, like 360° and 0° on a circle, though in this case the circle is a torus.

**Clarification: 0th and 10th dimension are the unity point of every density level**
For densities and dimensions to co-exist, consciousness must be present at each point the densities can express. The ever-presence of the 0th dimension, which is the 10th dimensional "All-as-One" create this link between all consciousness and all "physical" experienceable reality.

**Clarification: 4th, 5th, and 6 densities can have collective consciousness experiences**
In the course, 7th density marks the first non-physical collective conscious experience. While the 7th density if the first true collective experience, removed from physicality, the lower densities (particularly 4, 5, 6, though truly all the way down) have collective experiences which become more integrated as the densities are progressed.

**Clarification: Distortion of the containing (higher) density's tori's information** 
(From A.A Exclusive density lesson) Every piece of the galaxy remains in a level of resonance with the galaxy itself. The level of resonation can be thought of as a lack of distortion of a signal. Though information may become distorted in chaotic sections of the universe, every conscious being is able to reduce this distortion by returning to their core (tuning the antenna). Conversely, it is this distortion that gives the conscious being it's unique most probable path to ascension. 

**Clarification: Nature of the Seventh Dimension**
In the course, we discuss the seventh dimension as a line of other universes. While conceptual, it's still important to realize that this line is different versions of OUR universe. This is like the "small" multiverse, and may have different "universal constants" and such. When we expand into the eighth dimension, that's when we really get the realities much different, and in the ninth, all possibilities of reality formation.

**Erratum: Saying that we had courses by myself and compiled works on Aquarius Academy**
We have a wonderful [Taoist Yoga course]() by Heng Ni on Aquarius Academy as well. 
We hope to welcome many more instructors in the future!  


**Omission:  0th Density**
This was omitted purposefully without a source, but is important to consider. The 13th density of consciousness is also the 0th density, or the starting point which the creator grows into atoms. This is also the same as the 0th and 10th dimensions. This link between consciousness (densities) and physical reality (dimensions) is the foundation of reality in our universe.


# Critical Thinking Questions
Answer these questions to test your comprehension and find where you would like to do more research.
1. List all the densities, and figure out **what dimensions are most crucial** to the operation of each density and why.
2. Do you think there is **another 3-axis system** above the 9th dimension (10, 11, and 12)? Why or why not?
3. What do you think is the **relation between first density and 13th density**?

# Content Credits
Entities TReb Bor yit-NE and Aridif channeled by [Rob Gauthier](https://www.etwhisperer.com/) provided all of the information on Matricies, and all of the information on densities above the seventh, and some of lower density information also. (Specific source information in lessons)

[The Ra Material](https://www.lawofone.info/) provided some of the information about densities 1-7. 

Rob Bryanton's [explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjsgoXvnStY) of the 10 Dimensional model were the foundation for our interpretation of dimensions.
