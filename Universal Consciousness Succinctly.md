# Universal Consciousness Succinctly 
### The 7-11-12 Model of Universal Consciousness: Dimensions,  Densities, and Matrices

An Overview of the 7-11-12 model

There are 12 universal matrices, which are separate realities within our universe, with ascending levels of connectedness between the beings there. Physical interactions aren’t possible between different matrices.

Each of these matrices has 7 dimensions. The first four you are familiar with, height, width, depth, and time. The fifth and sixth expand time to allow multiple timelines to co-exist, so that every possibility can play out if conscious energy is focused there, and the seventh holds the universe itself as a point.

Densities allow layers of conscious experience to play out by the rules of the dimensions. There are 6 densities of physical beings and experience, 4 non-physical density experiences of collective consciousness, one experience of the universe itself, one of collectives of universes, and finally, the infinite creator in balance with non-existent nothingness.


# Dimensions

> “…In dimensions, there are literally only 7 that are experienceable in this matrix” - Aridif

Dimensions are **extensions**, which allow **measurement** of the previous dimensions below. The first dimension is one extension, the second is two, and so on. Every time we go up one dimension, we are extending all the previous dimensions outward in two brand new directions, **perpendicular** to the directions available before.

All of the information from the previous dimensions becomes just a **snapshot** of this new dimension.

I invite you to **visualize these dimensions** by extending them in your mind as we talk about each one.

We’ll bring along a cat with us starting at the third dimension to help us to digest the mind-bending concepts of higher dimensionality.

Before we dive in, here’s a **one-sentence overview**:

> The first three dimensions make up space, the next three make up time, the seventh is the universe in relation to other universes, and the zeroth is consciousness.

## The Dimensions
Starting at the bottom we have

### Dimension 0 = Perspective
A point has no dimensionality, only position.

This point is a **point of conscious perspective**, creating an infinite link between all dimensionality where the creator can perceive itself, as it is doing now through your eyes, ears, and mind.

Zero dimensionality is the **center unity point of the horn torus shape**, a concept we will further explore in the densities lesson. This center unity is the **link to all fractal consciousness**, and what enables consciousness to be here in the physical world. 


### 1st Dimension (Length) (Lines)
In the first dimension we have a **line**, one extension in two directions. This extension we call length.

### 2nd Dimension (Height) (Planes)
As we go to the second dimension, the line extends to have height.

Now we have an area, and are able to create all of the **2d shapes**, like squares, triangles, all that fun stuff!!

### 3rd Dimension (Depth) (Objects, Entities)
As we move to the third dimension, we **add depth**. Now we can make a cube, a sphere, a tetrahedron, or a cat.

Let’s call our cat Chessie, and bring him with us through the dimensions.

### 4th Dimension (Time) (Timelines)
If we want Chessie to chase a mouse, we need to extend our 3d world in the fourth dimension, time.

Time can be thought of as events that our 3d world goes through.

Events are 3d snapshots on a **4d timeline**. When we reference two or more events we are now in the fourth dimension.

[On Screen] [According to Plank, events happen 1.855e+43 times every second.]

Strings of events extend in both directions, future and past, to create a **timeline**. We can understand a fourth dimensional being by looking at their entire timeline from the beginning to end, for example the entire life of our cat Chessie.

We can assign an X value, let’s call it TimeX to how many events that Chessie has experienced, starting at 0 when the Chessie became incarnate.

We can look at any event in Chessies life (each event being a 3d snapshot) by specifying how far along the timeline the event took place, or simply put, how old Chessie was.

### 5th Dimension (Timeplanes)
In the fifth dimension, timelines are extended in another direction, just like how we went from a 1d line to a 2d area. Now we have an infinite number of **timelines beside each other**, just like the infinite parallel lines on a 2d plane.

Each of these timelines may have a different past and future, though they may also converge and diverge, and even crisscross, with the most splitting and merging occurring at **points of high-energy**.

The closest timelines represent very similar strings of events, maybe we wore a different shirt, but otherwise lived the same life. As we get further, the changes become greater, maybe we moved to a different city, met different people, became a different person.

Instead of just moving back and forth along a timeline from past to future, now we can move side to side to different timelines in the present, or diagonally to timelines in the past or future.

Returning to our cat Chessie, we still have the TimeX value of how old Chessie is, and now we also have a TimeY value which represents which timeline this particular Chessie’s events exists on, or if you fancy some Schrödinger, which Chessie is in the litter box.

### 6th Dimension (Time Entities / Time Objects)
Remember when we went from 2D to 3D, from a plane capable of only shapes, to a world with depth that could hold an entity like a cat?

When we **extend our parallel versions of timelines to have depth**, we get the sixth dimension. It’s just as big of a leap as we took from 2d to 3d.

In 6D we have **time-filling objects** and **entities within time**, just like in 3D we had space-filling objects and entities within space.

To simplify the concept, I will call these 6d entities **timeshapes**, but remember they are similar to a 3d object but with time instead of space, and they **can be intelligent**, like our cat Chessie.

Similar to how we need practically infinite layers to make a sphere from circles, we also need practically infinite layers of timelines to make a 6d timeshape.

To grasp this concept, let’s imagine we have our cat Chessie that exists on multiple timeline. On one of these timelines, Chessie escapes a closing door and runs free where he creates a litter of kitties with another cat. On another timeline, the door closes faster, and Chessie stays inside, and fathers no kitties.

Now, both of these timelines can be expressed within the fifth dimension from the perspective of Chessie, though in reality, whole layers of other timelines are getting involved.

For example, What about Chessie’s owner’s timeline? What about the kittens? What about everything in the world that interacts with the Chessie and all of his kittens?

**Just like the second dimension isn’t really experienceable in the 3rd dimensional spacetime, the fifth dimensional “flat” timelines aren’t really experienceable in the 6th dimensional timespace**, they are more like a way to look at the components of time entities, like a planar circle is a component of a sphere.

If we jump fifth dimensionally to a different timeline, the rest of reality has to snap around us to fit that, and the elastic timespace fabric that makes that snap is sixth dimensional.

#### *Back to our furry friends,*
Let’s imagine all of the interactions that our kitties will have. They all get adopted and go to loving homes, and become connected, influencing all of the timelines they interact with.

All of the interactions become a tree-like shape of weaved timelines. This is a **timeshape**, a shape that has **bounds in time**, instead of space. The shape has a beginning and end in time, just like a 3d object does in space. These timeshapes are basically bounds of **reality formation**, where every event within the bounds is **entangled**.

Let’s visualize this another way. Imagine the entire history of Earth, from coagulating dust, to being swallowed by the sun.
Watch all the movement on the planet in super speed like a buzz, from all the plant and animal life, to humans, and beyond. Now superimpose all of the possible timelines on top of this visualization.

If we take a step back, and try to imagine all of those timelines, we see that we **start off all together**. One rock. Then we balloon out into an incredible amount of energy and timelines, and finally we return to the **single possible end** of the sun swallowing the earth. 

You just visualized a 6-dimensional timeshape, one that contains literally every possibility for Earth. In that time shape every single possible reality for every single conscious entity exists. And not just as a possibility, but as experiences that arise from perspectives, collectively creating the 6-dimensional entity, Gaia.

***Pretty incredible.***

If you’re thinking, wait, isn’t everything entangled since the big bang? You’re completely correct. **Every possibility** for our universe is existing together as **one now**, and it’s the biggest time shape we know.


### 7th Dimension (Universal Plane)

The sixth dimension gave us timeshapes, so what are timeshapes a snapshot of?

*Let’s back up.* You may have noticed that in our model, the progression of dimensions 4, 5, and 6 were a lot like 1, 2, and 3, but with time instead of space.

So when we jump from 6 to 7th dimension, it **should be similar to when we jumped from the third dimension** to the 4th.

In that jump, we went from a universe of spacetime, or space at one time, to a universe of timespace, or time at one space. The structure of space became malleable through time, and time became malleable through space.

> So what happens when we go beyond time?

When we go beyond time, we go **outside of timespace/spacetime itself**, and our entire universe becomes a snapshot.

Moving through the seventh dimension, we have different expressions of time and space, which are separate universes.

In these other universes, the properties of time can be different, as can the properties of physical matter, if it exists at all in a given universe. An infinite range of possibilities exists.

## Final Words
You now understand the structure of our universe. In the next lesson we will talk about the layers of consciousness that inhabit this structure.

But first, I do want to say one more thing. While there are infinite timelines in theory, in practice, there are a smaller, but still huge, collection of highly probable timelines, **rivers of time flow**, bringing timelines together. This is the way. And this way is forged by collective attention. Our attention makes our way, and together, with all consciousness on the planet, we make the way for Gaia.

Together, by focusing our love, we can steer our version of Gaia onto a timeline of **harmony and incredible abundance** and collective consciousness expansion. And we are not alone. So many others are already doing this, and have been doing so for many thousands of years.

I’m so happy to be here to remind you of this simple fact and, if it is your desire, welcome you to join us by focusing your attention on loving connection. With each loving light, the path gets brighter for all.

> Before we move on, let’s do a quick review.

## Review and looking forward
We have a three-axis representation of space, dimensions one two, and three. We also have a three-axis representation of time, dimensions four five and six.

**The only “finished” dimensions that can fully explain a reality are the third and sixth dimensions**. This is because they contain all axes needed to express either space or time fully.

Finally, the **seventh dimension makes our entire universe just a snapshot**, one point on an infinite line of other universes. The model we just went over is our interpretation of the ten dimensional model accepted by many scientists today.

We are just stopping at 7 because that’s when we enter the multiverse, But, since we’re here, let’s go all the way. imagine that the next three dimensions, 7, 8 and 9, make up **another three-axis system**. Past space, further than time, we have another plane of existence, this time of realities. The 7th, 8th and 9th dimensions together hold **all possible realities**, with a tenth dimension that is it everything together, just like the 7th was all of timespace together.

You are now ready to dive into densities of consciousness, the final fundamental component of our model, and when you do, keep in mind everything you have learned here, it will help you greatly in your understanding and visualization of densities.

# Densities
In simple terms, a **density** refers to and ascending level or **layer of consciousness**.

Looking back to **dimensions**, all of the **knowable information was extended with each additional dimension**, making all previous information just a snapshot, so the dimension above has access to all the information, while the one below has only a tiny sliver of information about the dimension above it.

Densities, however, are **folded into each other**.


![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Torus_from_rectangle.gif)

If you imagine this torus coming together into a **horn torus** (below), you can see that the entire plane of information goes through the singular point in the center of the torus. This **singularity is the next density**, and each density level has a unity point linking it all the way up to source.


![Standard Horn Toruc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Standard_torus-horn.png)
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Les_trois_types_de_tores.PNG)

All consciousness collected in a certain density *is* the next density above. This means that even the **lowest level of consciousness is the highest level,** because the highest densities are nothing more than the sum of every level below, so **experience is always shared between every density of consciousness**.

> All is one, and one is all.

## Densities vs Dimensions 
Now you may be thinking, ***how is this different from dimensions?*** I thought the next dimension was just every snapshot of the dimensions below?

The difference between density growth and dimensional growth is geometrical, as **dimensions are planar**, and **densities are fractal**.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Gdx2Wp8jVYxUs/giphy.gif)

Though a higher dimension can access any of the lower levels, it can only view them through **moving in one “direction”** or the other, with the directional movement being on the “axis” representing that dimension, and that "axis: is the perpendicular expansion of every extension of the previous dimensions.

We can visualize this by **sliding a plane along an X or Y axis**. Dimensions allow energy (which is movement and Matter) to create the space that is needed for a rich variety of experience through interaction.

We can say that **dimensions work according to planar geometry**.

Densities work according to **fractal geometry**. Fractals are made of smaller versions of themselves, and each level can be visualized as a **torus-shaped bubble**, made up of a **unity point** and an **accelerating expansion, decelerating expansion, "stillness" or balance point, accelerating contraction, and decelerating contraction back into unity.**

The unity point enables **lower densities to access information from higher densities**, something lower dimensions can not do to higher dimensions.

Density **growth is returning** to this unity point, a central point which realizes the connection to the next level by combining all consciousness on its current level.

In this **unity experience**, you are now floating around a greater toroidal consciousness, again seeking unity. This greater toroidal consciousness, or bigger bubble, is made up of a bunch of bubbles which all are the completion of the previous level via a different experience of finding unity. It may help to imagine each bubble as a star in a galaxy.

Okay, so we know a **density contains all of the information of all of the densities it contains**, and the **lower density always has access to the higher densities information**, through a central core, which is the root of the fractal expression.

As we go through each density, **imagine what the core and the expansion represents**.

## Grouping Densities
We’re going to go through all the densities, but first let’s look at the groups of densities.

The first six densities are the **physical densities**, where consciousness may take a physical vessel. 

Above the sixth density there is nothing left to experience as a physical entity, it is just **energetic understanding**, “Being” in a non-physical sense.

**Four** of these nonphysical densities exist within our universe, incarnating as **collective consciousnesses**, and **planets** harboring **soul collectives**, **Star systems**, **galaxies**, and **collectives of galaxies**. 

The universe itself is its **own density**, as these first 10 combined together.

Outside of that, we have a density some call the multiverse, God Brain, or God Soul that is a **collective of all universes**.

Beyond that is the creator.

Let’s talk about each level in more detail.

> I’m going to spend the most time on the seventh through twelfth, as the Ra Material (Law of One) does a good job of the first six. Check out a video summary of Lo1 densities [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seaJcY0kXjk).

## 1. Matter - Awareness & Beingness
The first density is Atoms and **elemental substances** - Earth, Air, Fire, Water. This is the first level of experience the creator has in our universe.

## 2. Plant and Animal Life - Growth
In the second density, consciousness starts to interact with itself in an entity / environment way. Growth and expansion toward oneness is expressed in **plants reaching toward the Sun**. This energy is also expressed in animals seeking mates and food.

## 3. Self Awareness / Decisions

In the third density, **self awareness** develops, and with it **choice**, guarded by **free will**. The third density is unique because it operates under a veil of forgetting, or illusionary separation from source. 

This allows us to make an honest decision of **how we wish to progress** through the rest of the physical-body densities, by experiencing unity, or by experiencing separation.

Though if we choose separation we can’t make it past the start of the sixth density, as creating illusions of separation can only get you so far.

## 4. Evolved Humans - Love / Unity

In the fourth density we learn about **unconditional love**. This experience vibrates our future and past to the highest truth with love. 

Imagine a string that is tacked down in the middle, with both sides flowing freely beside. The string represents our timeline, and tack represents the present moment. 

**Love pulls the string taut**, creating the greatest and most resonant future and past in the now. 

As you can imagine, this creates the possibility for **near-instant healing** and **manifestation**, while still being in the physical world. 

**Collective attention** allows our strings to harmonize with others, vibrating together to experience a more loving future and past through the now. 

**The Earth Human collective** is now in the beginning of Fourth density, **moving toward a more unified, loving society**. This loving connection aligns us all with a **bright future**, as well as uncovers our **incredible past**. 

## 5. Wisdom
Within the fifth density, our vibration can transport us to **any perspective in the now**, and not only that, we can experience any future and past for that now.  

**Creation is unbounded**, as any thought form will bounce back to you through any number of realities, to meet you exactly at the vibration you sent out. **Wisdom is limitless**, as every angle of every possible future and past is experienceable. 

## 6. Oneness
The last physical experience is removing the illusion of self and other to realize and experience all as one. Remember that each density is all of the previous densities experiences put together, so the sixth density truly is **oneness of all experiences**. As we graduate through this density, we integrate all wisdom into oneness, and shed our unique perspective, to enter into the non-physical densities of collective consciousness. 

## 7. Collectives & Planets
The seventh density is the first non-physical experience. This experience can be expressed in what we might call a **collective consciousness**, or a grid of consciousness.

A seventh density entity can also be described as a collective soul, sometimes called an **oversoul**. A soul is an energetic part of us that goes on after we die, and an oversoul is a higher fractal iteration of our soul, meaning that we are a connected offshoot of an oversoul, like a twig to a branch.

Our oversoul is our higher self, and it contains infinite connectivity to **all experiences of every possible past and future** life, and all of these billions of lives are our higher self, and are all happening Right Now from a higher dimensional perspective.

When we die, we **return to the oversoul to be re-incarnated**, and the nature of this re-incarnation will align with our desire to create an exciting and fulfilling experience, usually growing in a direction we are headed, but sometimes starting again in a new direction entirely.

Our oversoul may incarnate as **any number of beings at the same** time. We are already incarnated in possibly billions of beings right now, and I mean just in this fourth dimensional now. 

One expression of a seventh density consciousness is that of a planet. **Seventh density collective consciousnesses create planets** through a collective desire.

How does this work? Seventh density entities are not bounded by time, so they create a planet through **collapsing possibilities with intention** to manifest and coalesce matter, space, dust, etc, etc, into an entire history and future of a planetary experience.

Oversouls don’t just wake up on a Tuesday and pop a planet in front of a star. They **create with intention throughout the entire galactic history.** Think back to the timeshape example where we imagined a buzzing earth timeshape. This will give you a visual of a seventh density entity.

**Gaia is a seventh density entity**, a collection of all consciousness on the planet, all the way down to the first density rocks and crystals. Gaia experiences all this life now, with the entire future and history of every being accessible at every moment. Plus every possible future and history…, all in the now.

Oversouls and planets combine to create the next level, the Solar system consciousness.

## 8. Solar system Consciousness
Solar system consciousnesses are the collection of planetary and oversoul consciousnesses that are **centered around a star**. Each planet is connected to a solar consciousness. Solar consciousnesses are connected to each other as well, and when we sum them all together, we get the ninth density.
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/d1zp7XeNrzpWo/giphy.gif)

## 9. Central galactic consciousness  

Our galaxy is the collection of all the solar consciousnesses, **connected through the core** like a faster-than-light-speed internet connection. All of the information from every level we talked about thus far is accessible through this galactic core.

This ninth density consciousness **governs the ascension process of all entities** in the galaxy, as it is made up of all of these beings.

> Visualizing the galaxy with the core at your heart chakra is a powerful meditation technique to integrate this energy directly into your ascension process.

## 10. Galactic Collectives
In this density, **galaxies come together** to form their own collective consciousnesses, like cells coming together to form a body. All of these consciousnesses combined create the universal consciousness, the next density.

## 11. The Universal Consciousness
Everything in the universe, including all 12 matrices, each with their 10 densities, form the 11th density, universal consciousness.

**The universe is having a physical incarnation**, much like us. It will leave this incarnation, and return to the 12th density consciousness, where it may make another incarnation.

## 12. The God Soul
Our universe exists alongside an **infinite number of universes**. Some of these universes are very similar to ours, carrying this 7 dimension / 11 density  / 12 matrix structure. Others are completely different, and may have no physical beings in them at all. All do, however, have **experience**, and **expansion**.

The connection of all of these universes creates a so-called **God Brain**, **God Mind** or **God Soul** where all universes are born, and where they return to when they leave their incarnation. This is like an oversoul of universes, where a universal consciousness may choose to expand in a new direction after they “disincarnate”. Similar to other collective consciousnesses, and stars in a galaxy, groups of countless universes co-create in clusters, creating all forms of possibilities.

## 13. The Infinite Source Creator
So what do we get when we combine all collectives of all universes? The infinite creator!

So what can create the infinite creator?

***Nothing**, of course?*

*But Seriously*, **nothing**.

*Nothingness.*

So, What is nothingness?

Nothingness is, by definition.. **nothing**, and therefore **cannot exist**. If nothingness can not, and does not exist, **everything must exist because nothing can be nothing**.

There must not be nothing anywhere.

**Nothing can be nothing.**

Everything must be something,

And something must be everywhere.

As since something is everywhere and everything is something, everything is everything.

And that everything as everything is the **source creator**, kept alive and in balance forever by nonexistent **nothingness**.

# Matrices

> “When most speak of dimensions, they are in fact truly speaking of matrices…” - Aridif

We are starting with Universal Matrices to clear up the following confusion.

> The idea of a “higher dimensional plane” is often verbalized as “another dimension”, and they could be perceived as such, but this is not entirely accurate. - Aridif

## So what is a Universal Matrix?

> “A matrix is a level within a [universal construct] that is it’s own environment” - Aridif

Matrices are **parallel realities** that have an increasing level of connection to creator energy with each higher matrix.

In our universe, there are 12 of these matrices.

Think of these like the 12 musical notes in the chromatic scale. 

Each note is essentially the same thing, sound.

Or in our case, **a universe**.

But each note sounds different, because as we go up the scale, the vibrations get higher.

As the vibrations go higher in our matrices, the connections of the entities within the universal matrix is enhanced.

The next note up, or in our case universal matrix above will appear very similar to ours, with a physical Earth and even a You, but each piece is more connected to each other and to source.

Together, the matrices form a **complete expression of all things the universe wants to experience**, just like the 12 notes in the chromatic scale allow musicians to create all the sounds they need to express themselves in song.

In music, these notes interact, but in our universe, these matrices are a bit more separate. We can’t travel through them without going up to the density of the universe itself, 11th density.

We are able, however, to feel and experience them through a 3rd-party perspective.

In-tune beings can peer into the matrix directly above and below by connecting to the universal consciousness, but they can’t really influence them or gain a physical presence there.

The connection between matrices is much more than just a glass wall we can only see through. This connection subtly influences the possibilities that each matrix has on the most fundamental and universal levels.

Though physical interaction is not (commonly) possible, information transfer is possible, and if it’s possible for us to share experience, imagine what's happening all the time at the lower and higher densities.

The implications of this are unknown, but it’s likely that the range of possible grooves of conscious experience are expanded, with a far greater range, in both connection and separation.

All Matrices are connected through the 11th density, and they all are a part of the universal consciousness.

Aridif has said that the 12th matrix is that of the archangels, [(source)](https://www.gaia.com/video/aridif-ancient-pleiadian) which makes me believe that beings at the highest matrices can have slightly more harmonizing influence on the lower matrices, and can reach their love down to be experienced by beings in the lower matrices. 

This could mean that our own archangels, and even the archetypes, which harmonize our experiences in this universe are brought into our universal matrix from a the highest matrix. 

These presences do have influence on this plane. Although this may seem to contradict what we have said about the inter-matrix barrier, a higher-level matrix (like the 12th/12 matrix) would be in close communication with the 11th density consciousness, meaning consciousness from there could incarnate into our matrix quite easily. 

Matrices aren’t as much a part of our daily experience as dimensions and densities, but they do need to be explored for a complete picture of our universal consciousness.

## Review and looking forward

Let’s review what we’ve learned.

In our universe there are **12 matrices**, each of which **enhances each other’s expressive abilities**, allowing our experience to be particularly rich, kind of like how different notes create rich musical chords.

Each matrix holds **6 dimensions** and **10 densities of consciousness**. Combined they make the seventh dimension, and the 11th density. If that makes no sense, don’t worry, it will soon.

Incarnating between matrices is only possible when you reach 11th density, universal consciousness.

Peering up and down into the other matrices is possible, but we **cannot physically go into them**, or even incarnate into them without going through the 11th density.

You now understand one of the three fundamental components of the universe. Next up, we’ll explore dimensions, and meet my friend *Chessie*.
